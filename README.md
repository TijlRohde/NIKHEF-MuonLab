# NIKHEF-MuonLabIII
 
The NIKHEF MuonLab III detector is a commercially available particle detector. With this code, it can be used to execute various experiments, including determining the lifetime of Muons and their velocities, either through a GUI or through terminal controls. Additionally, .ipynb notebooks are provided to perform guided data analysis on the measurements performed. They are written to be accessible, and require no previous knowlegde of Python.
